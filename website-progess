Work in Progress
The website is currently under development and not yet in its final form.

Focus on JavaScript
I am actively working on improving the JavaScript part of the website to add more dynamic features, interactive elements, and smoother user experiences.

Interactivity Goals
The aim is to make the website more engaging by adding animations, dynamic content updates, better form handling, and interactive project showcases.

Future Content Updates
I plan to add more detailed descriptions for each project, highlight key skills and experiences, and expand the content to provide more insights about my work.

Design Enhancements
I will continue refining the design to make the website cleaner, more modern, and fully responsive across different devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

New Features Coming Soon
Future plans include adding a blog section, integrating a live chat or contact form, and possibly including downloadable resumes or project documentation.

Learning and Growth
This project is not just about building a portfolio — it’s also about practicing and improving my skills in frontend development, JavaScript, UI/UX design, and performance optimization.

Long-Term Vision
Over time, the website will become a central hub where I not only showcase my work but also collaborate with others, share updates, and build a stronger online presence.

Thank You Note
I appreciate everyone who visits the site during this early stage and look forward to sharing the final version soon!
